# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Key Concepts
- Memoization vs Tabulation
- State definition and transition
- Overlapping subproblems

## Patterns
- Fibonacci / stair-climbing
- 0/1 Knapsack / Unbounded Knapsack
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Matrix DP (min cost paths)

## ML Relevance
- Optimization, sequence modeling, algorithmic thinking
