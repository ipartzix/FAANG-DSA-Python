# FAANG-DSA-Python

![Repo Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DSA-FAANG%20Level-blue)

## Overview

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of FAANG-level Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems in Python**, designed for:

- **Primary goal:** ML Engineer interview preparation  
- **Backup goal:** SDE interview preparation  

The repo is **topic-wise organized** and gradually scales from **easy → medium → hard** problems.
