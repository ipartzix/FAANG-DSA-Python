## Data Structure

A data structure is a way of **organizing and storing data** so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Choosing the correct data structure directly impacts:
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Overall performance of the algorithm

### Types of Data Structures

1. **Linear Data Structures**
   - Elements are stored sequentially
   - Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**
   - Elements are stored hierarchically or graph-based
   - Examples: Tree, Graph, Heap

### Why Data Structures Matter

- Faster search, insert, delete operations
- Efficient memory usage
- Cleaner and more scalable solutions

### Key Principle

Efficient problem solving in DSA =
Right Algorithm + Right Data Structure
